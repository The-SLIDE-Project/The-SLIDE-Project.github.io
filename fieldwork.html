            The SLIDE team have deployed over 200 scientific instruments on the glacier over two years (2023 and 2024), camping on or close to the glacier. This has involved a team of over 25 scientists, with more than 700 person-days in the field. Logistical support is provided by Chris SÃ¸rensen and the Kangerlussuaq International Science Support (KISS) Centre.

            Although the project is focused on the lakes that exist under the ice, there is also a very large lake that is trapped against the ice, i.e. the ice acts like a giant dam. This lake is about 3 km across and 100 m deep (volume of ~163 million cubic meters, or 65,200 Olympic swimming pools!) and, just like the lakes under the ice, slowly fills before catastrophically draining in a flood under the ice. Last October (2023) this happened, with our sensors picking up the ~10 day-duration glacial lake outburst flood.

            We have deployed a range of geophysical sensors to monitor the flow of the ice and to remotely explore the hidden world that exists underneath the glacier. To do this we use:
