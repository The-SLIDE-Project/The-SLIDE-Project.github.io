            Once we have all the field data we will use this information to build up a picture of how water is moving and being stored under the ice and the impact it has on ice flow. To help do this we will use a numerical model, which acts like a very powerful calculator to help us understand the wider impact of the subglacial lakes and water flow using numbers and equations. We will plug in our results and then vary them to simulate a range of different scenarios that might represent different areas of Greenland or a warming world - for example, by increasing the amount of melt or making the ice thicker or flatter - to see how it impacts their behaviour.
